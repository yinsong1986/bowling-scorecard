You should see results as below.

    Creating a new score card
    []
    Add the 1st frame
    [[10]]
    Add the 2nd frame
    [[10] [7 3]]
    Add the 3rd frame
    [[10] [7 3] [7 2]]
    Add the 4th frame
    [[10] [7 3] [7 2] [9 1]]
    Add the 5th frame
    [[10] [7 3] [7 2] [9 1] [10]]
    Add the 6th frame
    [[10] [7 3] [7 2] [9 1] [10] [10]]
    Add the 7th frame
    [[10] [7 3] [7 2] [9 1] [10] [10] [10]]
    Add the 8th frame
    [[10] [7 3] [7 2] [9 1] [10] [10] [10] [2 3]]
    Add the 9th frame
    [[10] [7 3] [7 2] [9 1] [10] [10] [10] [2 3] [6 4]]
    Add the 10th frame
    [[10] [7 3] [7 2] [9 1] [10] [10] [10] [2 3] [6 4] [7 3 3]]
    Show the final score:
    168
       
## Examples of using the APIs

###1. Create an empty score card

    (new-scorecard) ;-> []

###2. Given a score card, score a frame

    (def score_card (new-scorecard)) ; create a new scorecard
    (score-a-frame score_card "x") ;-> [["x"]]
    (score-a-frame score_card "7" "/") ;-> [["7" "/"]]
    (score-a-frame score_card "7" "2") ;-> [["7" "2"]]

###3. Determine whether a game is complete - if so, provide the final score

    (def score_card [["x"] ["7" "/"] ["7" "2"] ["9" "/"] ["x"] ["x"] ["x"] ["2" "3"] ["6" "/"] ["7" "/" "3"]])
    (check-complete score_card) ;-> 168
